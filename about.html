Unfortunately we have no idea what to say next, so we are going to just paste some lyrics from Queens of the Stone Age. 
    She said, "I'll throw myself away.
    They're just photos after all."
    I can't make you hang around.
    I can't wash you off my skin.
    
    Outside the frame is what we're leaving out
    You won't remember anyway
    
    I can go
    With the flow
    (I can go)
    Time will say it doesn't matter (with the flow), matter anymore
    I can go
    With the flow
    (I can go)
    Do you believe it in your head?
    
    It's so safe to play along
    Little soldiers in a row
    Falling in and out of love
    Something sweet to throw away.
    
    I want something good to die for
    To make it beautiful to live.
    I want a new mistake,
    Lose is more than hesitate.
    Do you believe it in your head?
    
    I can go
    With the flow
    (I can go)
    Don't say it doesn't matter (with the flow), matter anymore
    I can go
    With the flow
    
    (I can go)
    Do you believe it in your head?
    (with the flow)
    Do you believe it in your head?
    Do you believe it in your head?

    Clone radio we play the songs that sound
    More like everyone else than anyone else
    Clone"
    "Hey alright, it's Kip Kasper
    Clone radio, LA's infinite repeat
    How we feelin' out there?
    How's your drive time commute?
    I need a saga
    What's the saga?
    It's Songs for the Deaf
    You can't even hear it"
    Dead bull with the life from the low
    I'll be massive conquistador
    Give me soul and show me the door
    Metal heavy, soft at the core
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Pressurize, neutralize
    Deep fried, gimme some more
    Space trucking, four on the floor
    Fortified with the liquor store
    This one's down, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Shrunken head I love to adore
    B-movie, gimme some gore
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    B-movie, gimme some gore
    Uh
    Yow
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more
    Gimme toro, gimme some more</p>
